# Examples

Concrete examples and use case explorations.

## Purpose

This section contains:
- **Worked examples:** Step-by-step walkthroughs with real transactions
- **Use case explorations:** Speculative applications of Uniteum

## Disclaimer

Use cases are exploratory. We don't know what works until people try it. Some ideas may be impractical, uneconomical, or broken in ways we haven't discovered.

See [Safety](/safety/).

## Coming Soon

- Dimensional analysis use case (physics units)
- Gaming/virtual economy example
- Multi-hop arbitrage walkthrough
- Liquidity provision strategy

## Contributing

Have an interesting use case? We'd love to hear about it.
