# Handoff Template (Claude ↔ ChatGPT)

## Goal
(One sentence: what we are trying to change/add.)

## Authoritative constraints
- Source of truth: Unit.json (uploaded separately)
- Canonical rules:
  - No negative exponents in canonical output
  - Reciprocal rendered structurally as 1/x
- Forge model:
  - Units are ERC-20 tokens
  - Forge mints/burns across triads (a, b, a^1:2*b^1:2)
  - No higher-order invariant beyond triads

## Files to touch
- (list)

## “Definition of done”
- (bullets: what must be true when merged)

## Notes / pitfalls
- (anything we must not regress)
